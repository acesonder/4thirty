PURPOSE:
I want to feel seen. Like my story matters. If there’s a place where I can learn about what I’m going through or see that others made it out, it would help me believe I can too. Sometimes, I just need to know I’m not the only one struggling.

PURPOSE:
What I really need is someone to stick with me—not give up after the first no-show or relapse. A place that actually tracks my case, knows what I’ve already tried, and helps me keep going. I want a second chance that doesn’t feel like a dead end.

PURPOSE:
I don’t even know what’s out there, let alone how to apply. I just want someone to show me where to go without making me jump through hoops. If there’s one system that can help me find help fast, I’ll use it. I just need direction.

PURPOSE:
There are nights I just need someone to talk to, even if I don’t know what to say. I’m not ready to walk into a center, but I’d message someone. Especially if I knew they’d actually listen. I need a safe way to ask for help without judgment.
